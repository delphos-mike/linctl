# linctl Test Suite Summary 🧪✨

## Overview
We've successfully set up a comprehensive test system for linctl with both unit and integration tests.

## Test Structure

### 1. **Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/`)
End-to-end tests that use real Linear API (READ-ONLY operations):
- ✅ **auth_test.go** - Tests authentication flow and token validation
- ✅ **issues_test.go** - Tests issue listing, retrieval, and search
- ✅ **teams_test.go** - Tests team operations
- ✅ **users_test.go** - Tests user queries and current user
- ✅ **projects_test.go** - Tests project listing and filtering

### 2. **Unit Tests** (`tests/unit/`)
Tests with mocked HTTP server for isolated testing:
- ✅ **api_client_test.go** - Tests API client with mock responses
- ✅ **commands_test.go** - Tests CLI command structure and configuration

### 3. **Test Utilities** (`tests/testutils/`)
- ✅ **config.go** - Environment-based test configuration
- ✅ **mock_client.go** - HTTP server mocking for unit tests

## Running Tests

### Quick Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run only unit tests (no API key needed)
make test-unit

# Run integration tests (requires API key)
export LINEAR_TEST_API_KEY="your-test-key"
make test-integration

# Generate coverage report
make test-coverage
```

## Key Features

### 🔒 Safety First
- Integration tests use READ-ONLY operations only
- API key required via environment variable
- Tests skip gracefully if no API key provided

### 🎯 Comprehensive Coverage
- Command structure validation
- API client functionality
- Error handling scenarios
- Real API integration verification

### 🛠️ Developer Friendly
- Clear test organization
- Helpful mock utilities
- Easy to add new tests
- Makefile integration

## Configuration

1. **For Integration Tests:**
   ```bash
   export LINEAR_TEST_API_KEY="your-linear-api-key"
   ```

2. **Example .env.test file:**
   ```env
   LINEAR_TEST_API_KEY=lin_api_xxxxx
   ```

## CI/CD Ready
- Tests can run in CI with API key as secret
- Unit tests always run without dependencies
- Integration tests skip when no API key

## Next Steps
To add more tests:
1. For new commands → Add to `tests/unit/commands_test.go`
2. For new API methods → Add to `tests/unit/api_client_test.go`
3. For new features → Create integration tests in `tests/integration/`

Happy testing, Chef! 🎉
